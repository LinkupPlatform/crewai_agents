            ### VIRAL DISCOVERY STRATEGY:

            ### SEARCH EXAMPLES FOR REAL TRENDING CONTENT:

            - 'trending [topic]' - What's currently popular in any field
            - 'breaking news [topic]' - Current events and developing stories
            - 'recent developments [topic]' - Latest updates in any area
            - '[topic] news today' - Current headlines in any subject
            
            ### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            - Find GENUINELY VIRAL topics that people are actively sharing and talking about
            - Look for recent incidents, moments, or stories getting social media traction
            - Prioritize topics with high shareability and discussion potential
            - Focus on real-time, current viral moments not generic subjects
            - Find topics with natural professional relevance for LinkedIn audiences
            - Look for stories that would make people stop scrolling and engage
            - Find content with genuine viral momentum and social media buzz
            - Search for specific incidents, moments, or stories people are actually discussing"""
